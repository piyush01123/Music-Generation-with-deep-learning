All this love
Is all I am,
A ball is all I am.
I'm so new
Compared to you
And I am very small.
Warm glow,
Moon glow,
Always need a little more room.
Waiting here,
Seems like years,
Never see the light of day.All around
I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear.
Red the light
And dark the night
I feel my dawn is near.
Warm glow,
Moon glow,
Always need a little more room.
Whisper low
Here I go,
I will see the sunshine show.
