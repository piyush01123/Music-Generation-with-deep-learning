Ooooh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
Don't say it's the end of the road.
Remember the flowers I sent.
I need you, Babe,
To put through the shredder in front of my friends.
Oh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
How could you go?
When you know how I need you,
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night.
Oh Babe,
Don't leave me now.
How can you treat me this way?
Running away.
Oh Babe,
Why are you running away?
