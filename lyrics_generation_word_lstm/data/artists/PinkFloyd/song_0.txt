Bridges burning gladly
Merging with the shadows,
Flickering between the
lines.
Stolen moments floating softly on the air,
Borne on wings of fire
and climbing higher.Ancient bonds are breaking,
Moving on and
changing sides.
Dreaming of a new day,
Cast aside the other way.Magic visions stirring,
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes.The doorway stands ajar,
The walls that once were high.
Beyond
the gilded cage,
Beyond the reach of ties.
The moment is at hand.She breaks the golden band.
