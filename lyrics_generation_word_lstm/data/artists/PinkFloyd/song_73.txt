Please, far away from me, Lucy
Oh, go little girl
Seen, is (oh so) broken up about you, Lucy
Mean, treat me and done me harm, Lucy
Been, in love with you and your charms, Lucy
Oh, go little girl
I'm in love with you, Lucy
You got my heart

You tear me apart
You just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breath
Now Lucy leave, LucyLeave, when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please, far away from me, little girl

Seen, is (oh so) broken up about you, Lucy
