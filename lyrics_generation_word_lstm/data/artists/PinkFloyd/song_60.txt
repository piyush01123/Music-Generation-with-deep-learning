It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet, sometimeEverybody wakes, and in the morning
Hot tea and can't stop yawning
Pass the butter please.
Have you ever read the Daily Standard?
Reading all about the plane that's landed
Upside down?And no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to sayIt would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometimeEverybody cares about the weather
And everybody should know better
What a waste of time
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling
Living out a dream that sends them reeling
To a distant placeBut no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to sayIt would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
