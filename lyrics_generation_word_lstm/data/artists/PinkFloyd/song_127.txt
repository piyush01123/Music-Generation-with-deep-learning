When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers
Who would hurt the children any way they could
"Ooof" (someone being hit)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
(mananical laughter)But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives
