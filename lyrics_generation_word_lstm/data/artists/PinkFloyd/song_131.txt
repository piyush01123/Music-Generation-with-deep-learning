I was standing by the Nile
Whe I saw the lady smile.
I would take her out for a while,
For a while. Light tears wept like a child.
How her golden hair was blowing wild.
Then she spread her wings to fly,
For to fly. Soaring high above the breezes,
Going always where she pleases.
She will make it to the island in the sun.
I will follw in her shadow
As I watch her from my window.
One day I will catch her eye. She is calling from the deep,
Summoning my soul to endless sleep.
She is bound to drag me down,
Drag me down.
