Arnold layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view, see through baby blue
Oh, arnold layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layneNow he's caught - a nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang - chain gang - he hates it
Oh, arnold layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layne, arnold layneDon't do it again
