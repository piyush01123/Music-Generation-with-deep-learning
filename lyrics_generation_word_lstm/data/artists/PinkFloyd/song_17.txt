Wasting my time,
Resting my mind
And I'll never pine
For the sad days and the bad days
When we was workin' from nine to five.
And if you don't mind
I'll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light and the love in her eyes.
And if you don't mind
I'll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of her eyes
